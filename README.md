### Insights & Recommendation
---
- Although the robot category generates high revenue, the number of units sold is still low.
  Recommendation: Develop a marketing strategy that includes content showing real-life testimonials or how the product solves specific tasks like automating vacuuming and mopping          schedules during work hours. You can also introduce bundling promotions with robot kits during major online shopping days.
- The most purchased categories are ebooks and training videos, but they contribute less revenue.
  Recommendation: Launch targeted campaigns during key moments such as school/college semester breaks or before civil service exam and aptitude tests for fortune 500 companies. These      campaigns should highlight how training videos help solve skill gaps, and offer bundled videos with related skills to increase value perception.
- Cities like Washington, Houston, and Sacramento show the highest number of transactions, but the average order value is relatively low, suggesting that revenue is spread across many     regions.
  Recommendation: Maximize sales potential in these high-performing areas by running localized Instagram/Facebook ads with special offers or limited-time events tailored to those cities.
